Rent is $1420 per month (does not include internet, electricity, or parking). \nI am looking preferably a October 15th move in but I can be flexible from the 15th to November 1st. The amenities include a pool, gym, movie theater, full size basketball court and more. The bedroom is pretty spacious - it can fit a queen size bed, a desk, and a dresser comfortably. The dresser is currently in the closet which gives more room in the bedroom. The apartment is walking distances to lots of bars, restaurants, shopping, grocery stores, and public transportation. \nI am a 31 year old woman grad student who also works full time. I am laid back, clean, and respectful. I am looking for someone who values the same things. This person must also like/tolerates cats as I have a sweet boy who loves to play and cuddle. \nMessage me for more details and if you want a tour!
